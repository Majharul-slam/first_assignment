        <h2>HOPE</h2>

        <P> <span>PLOT</span>The often misunderstood rapper, XXXTentacion, felt the need to speak out on the tragedy as
          a native Floridian. This
          tragedy hit close to home for X, sparking the artist to create a new record, “Hope,” in memory of the victims.
          He took
          to Instagram to explain the intended impact of “Hope.”In wake of America’s latest mass shooting at Florida’s
          Stoneman Douglas High School, the country is pushing for new gun
          control reform more than ever to prevent horrific events like the one from ever happening again.
